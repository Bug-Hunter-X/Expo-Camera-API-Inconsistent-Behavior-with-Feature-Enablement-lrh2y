This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API with specific camera features enabled.  The error message isn't always descriptive but often manifests as a blank screen where the camera preview should be, or a crash with a generic native module error. This happens inconsistently, making debugging difficult. The problem seems linked to enabling features like barcode scanning or face detection within the camera configuration. Disabling these features resolves the issue, but limits the functionality of the application.
