# Expo Camera API Bug: Inconsistent Behavior with Feature Enablement

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API with specific features enabled. The issue results in an inconsistent display of the camera preview or a crash.  The bug is intermittent, making debugging challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application using `expo start`.
4. Observe the camera preview. The issue might manifest as a blank screen or an application crash. The frequency of the bug varies.

## Solution

The provided solution involves disabling the problematic features in the camera configuration (`barcodeScanning`, `faceDetection`, etc.). While this resolves the bug, it limits the functionality.  A more robust solution involves identifying and addressing the root cause within Expo's Camera API or related native modules.
